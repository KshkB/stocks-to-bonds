# Bonds and stocks RROI

In the `main` branch of this repository are python modules for analysing and valuing Australian Government Bonds, sketching the yield curve and calculating the stock to bond RROI. 

For the background theory on this calculation and a demonstration of how to analyse bonds and stocks please see the documentation, hosted [here](https://kshkb.github.io/stocks-to-bonds/intro.html).

In the `gh-pages` branch are the HTML/CSS files for creating the documentation linked above. It was built with `Jupyter Book`.

**Note.** *The means by which data is obtained is through scraping it from either Yahoo finance or the Australian Government Bonds website.*

## Requirements

The python packages needed to execute functions in the python modules in `main` are:

- `numpy`;
- `pandas`;
- `matplotlib`;
- `scipy`;
- `bs4`;
- `requests`;
-  `datetime`;
- `math`
