# Bonds and stocks RROI

In the `main` branch of this repoitory are python modules for analysing and valuing Australian Government Bonds, sketching the yield curve and calculating the stock to bond RROI. 

For the background theory about this calculation and a demonstration of how to implement functions in the python modules please see the documentation, hosted [here](https://kshkb.github.io/stocks-to-bonds/intro.html)

In the `gh-pages` branch are the HTML/CSS files for creating the documentation linked above. It was built with `Jupyter Book`.

## Requirements

The python packages needed to execute functions in the python modules in `main` are:

- `numpy`;
- `pandas`;
- `matplotlib`;
- `scipy`;
- `bs4`;
- `requests`;
-  `datetime`;
- `math`
