# Bond valuation and stock RROI

This documentation concerns the valuations of bonds and of stocks relative to bonds. The first tab, `Stock RROI relative to bonds (theory)`, presents the general theory underlying the calculation of a stock (or stock market's) *required return on investment relative to bond* $B$, or, *RROI/B* for short. The tab `Bond valuation tutorial` illustrates functions in `functions.py` and `yield_sketch.py` tailored to analysing investment grade, Australian Government Treasury Bonds (eTBs). The tab `Stocks to bonds RROI tutorial` illustrates functions in `functions.py` tailored to calculating the RROI relative to eTBs. 

Note, the primary means of gathering data is through scraping it from either Yahoo finance or the official Australian Government Bonds website.
